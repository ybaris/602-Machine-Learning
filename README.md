# Predicting an NBA Player’s Points per Game Project

## DATA 602 - Int. to Data Analysis and Machine Learning 
This course provides a broad introduction to the practical side of machine-learning and data analysis. This course examines the end-to-end processing pipeline for extracting and identifying useful features that best represent data, a few of the most important machine algorithms, and evaluating their performance for modeling data. Topics covered include decision trees, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, linear and non-linear regression, basic functions, support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian networks, bias/variance theory, ensemble methods, clustering, evaluation methodologies, and experiment design.

## Project Goal: 
The purpose of this study was to determine which method of analysis gave the most accurate result. The purpose of the models was to see how closely they could predict a player’s points per game. The data set being analyzed is categorized by each player and includes minutes played, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, total rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and points. By using these statistics, the goal is to find the best model for predicting points per game for an individual athlete. Different supervised learning models including linear regression, lasso and ridge regression, and random forest are used, and their results are compared.
