# DATA 602 Intro to Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project
This course provides a broad introduction to the practical side of machine-learning and data analysis. This course examines the end-to-end processing pipeline for extracting and identifying useful features that best represent data, a few of the most important machine algorithms, and evaluating their performance for modeling data. Topics covered include decision trees, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, linear and non-linear regression, basic functions, support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian networks, bias/variance theory, ensemble methods, clustering, evaluation methodologies, and experiment design.

This was our project for Machine Learning class. The aim of the project is to compare different regression models, to predict points per a game for different NBA players. 
We used Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regression models.
